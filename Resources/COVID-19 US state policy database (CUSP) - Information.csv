"Data track dates of policy implementation, rather than when policies were passed",,
"We only record orders or directives, not guidance or recommendations",,
We only record state-wide orders,,
"We are working quickly to go through state government websites to make the policy database as complete and accurate as possible in a rapidly changing policy context. If you use data on a given policy, we encourage you to triangulate based on additional sources of policy data and to review the source documentation to consider the coding decisions that are right for your work. Of course, please email us if you note a discrepancy so we can improve the database for everyone",,
We regularly review policies and work to keep them as up to date as possible. We note the date of the last comprehensive review at the top of this page. ,,
